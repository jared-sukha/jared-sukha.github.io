      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>
        When being interviewed for Dev Academy I said I wanted to enter employment as a developer asap, while this is true, upon reflection I have considered another goal and that would be to acquire the skills to head into app development - I have ideas and am very keen to investigate them.
      </p>

<h3>      A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
      
      <p>
        Curiosity can be both a strength and a limitation as I've learnt in the most recent sprint. Through curiosity I'm often pushing myself to pick up new concepts or new material but sometimes this curiosity can distract me from the task at hand and lead me down many long, twisting rabbit holes.
      <br>
      <br>
      I consider my perseverance in problem solving also a strength as this is how I'm often learning/solving problems by continually trying to discover a solution, but unfortunately this could be considered a limitation as well - as maybe this time could be better spent seeking out the help of others...
    </p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      
      <p>
      Communication and leadership. I've found that I'm hesitant to communicate as much as others seem to be in foundation (maybe this is a natural aversion to social media??). I felt leadership was something that sat well with me in my youth but is something that I've avoided in recent years, I would like to hopefully push myself to become more of a leader.

      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. How you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A commitment to breaks from the computer, managing time boxes and keeping to task at hand. Keeping up exercise and eating well. And do everything I can to be a positive influence on those around me.
    </p>
      
      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
      Take a mini break, re-evaluate and make/adjust a workplan and if needed talk it out/seek out support with those around me (fellow cohorts, facilitators and friends/family support). 
    </p>
    <h3>  
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
  </h3>
  <p>
      As above.
    </p> 
      <h3>
      A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
    </h3>
    <p>  
    Technical support and guidance.
  </p>
      <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the moment I don't have any strict commitments, this allows me to work 9-5pm largely uninterrupted (besides lunch and short breaks). I do like to exercise early and and be prepped and ready for the day well before 9am. Evenings are a little looser where work is done according to workload and how I feel.
