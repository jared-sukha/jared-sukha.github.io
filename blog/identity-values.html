        A dilemma
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a young professional, I had a task with an approaching deadline, and unfortunately because I had been so busy I had barely been able to start it. The situation was that if I solely worked on the task at hand (and ignored all other work) I <em>may</em> make the deadline but on the other hand, I could also still miss it. The client rang me to check how things were going, I could have told him that we were absolutely fine, but I chose to be honest and inform them that not only was there a chance that I may not make the deadline but that I had also barely started the task due to my current workload. The client was obviously unhappy but appreciated the honesty and was able to shift the deadline out a couple of days resulting in us making the new deadline. While the deadline was able to be shifted (luckily), the client would have appreciated knowing my situation as early as possible, so I learned that I needed to work on my communication (especially when at my busiest).

      <h3>Culture, values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My Dad is a NZ born Indian whose parents migrated to NZ. My Mum is NZ European whose roots are of a mix from somewhere in Europe. Growing up in New Zealand has exposed me to many cultures where Honesty, kindness and health (being physically active) were always common themes.

      <h3>My strengths and limitations.</h3>
        <p>
          Recently completing an online DOPE test, I discovered that Curiosity is a strength of mine that I hadn’t considered before. I am often thinking of how some tasks on a computer could be achieved more efficiently, and often find myself striding off the beaten path and finding and adopting new methods of doing tasks. I feel this curiosity has held me in good stead professionally and is what lead me to Dev Academy :)
        </p> 
<p>Adaptability is  to be able to switch from task to task, changing deadlines, juggling lots of tasks.
</p> 
          A weakness that I perhaps hadn’t considered before but is something that again resonates is leadership. Leadership doesn’t come naturally to me especially when in new environments. I feel working on this weakness could work better for me in a professional setting.
    
      <h3>	A strength that might help me in my learning journey.</h3>
    <p>
          Adaptability - when confronted with a problem, I can switch it up, move on and come back to it later.
        </p>
          
    <h3>Tension</h3>
    <p>      
    In the past I have worked with a colleague who had a gruff nature and in this example his demeanour was particularly affecting the mood and productivity of the workplace environment to the point that it almost felt like a personal attack. I made the decision to communicate directly with the colleague, first asking if he was okay, then expressed how his behaviour made me feel. He apologised for how it made me feel and assured me that wasn’t his intention. There was some improvement in his mood and demeanor so it was effective, however in the future if I were to address a similar situation again, I think I would first, offer if there was anything that I or us as a team could do to help improve the environment and then follow with how I felt.
