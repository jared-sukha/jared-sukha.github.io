        Problem Solving

        <p>
        A simple problem that tripped me up was in the Javascript Intro. There was one activity where we had to create a countdown function, basically it would take a list eg [blastoff, 1,2,3] and we had to print it in reverse so it would countdown [3,2,1,blastoff]. I thought I had cracked it but the countdown was producing an error, I read the error message which said something like 'undefined' which meant nothing to me, all I knew was it wasn't what I wanted. I tried a few things which produced a few different results but still no luck, so as time went on I was feeling a little anxious, eventually I noticed on Discord that someone had the same problem, that coupled with some googling solved the issue and everything fell into place logically. I learned that I should probably seek out help earlier if I'm worried about time spent problem solving.

        A problem I solved elegantly was when I was sure a function I had wrote was correct but it still threw up an error, instead of panicking, I elegantly read the text which mentioned a syntax error so I carefully counted up my brackets and of course I had missed one. Early on in this sprint, an error that spawned a red wall of text was cause for panic, but after countless errors I've managed to get a handle on what some of the red text means and how I can use it to solve the problem at hand.
