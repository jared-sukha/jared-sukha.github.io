        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
  
        <ol>
          <li>Reluctance to ask for help</li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>values - attitude about how we go about our work</li>
          <li>empathy - seeing the ability to help in others</li>
          <li>self awareness - being aware of our own abilities and when we should keep our ego in check</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          How much I’ve enjoyed it, especially neuroplasticity, mindfulness and mindset work. And also how difficult it's been to answer the core learning material!
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Writing and sharing personal thoughts, and I guess just the practice of looking inwards and trying to see what makes me tick.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          From what I’ve seen of the core content, a lot of it tends to support the technical learning, with the focus on mindset being an obvious example. 
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          NO WAY! I think for me personally trying to solely practise on programming would have had limited results, while I may have eventually learnt the technical aspects, I feel it would probably take a lot longer. I feel the core component of the course so far has helped lay a great foundation for the next phase of the course, by not just being aware of how I operate but it's also made me more mindful of the people around me.
