        What is Emotional Intelligence?
      </h3>
        <p>
         Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, understand and manage emotions in yourself and people around you.
        </p>
      <h3>
        How is it different to IQ?
      </h3>
        <p>
        IQ could be attributed to 'book smarts' or the ability to learn and retain knowledge or information. 
        </p>
      <h3>
        Why is it important?
      </h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is an important aspect of social communication and relationship building. Research has suggested that those with high emotional intelligence correlates with strong leadership potential. High EQ also contributes to better decision making by not letting emotions lead to brash decisions.
