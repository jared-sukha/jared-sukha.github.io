        Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
      </h3>
        <p>
         Neuroplasticity, how cool is it? The answer is mega cool. The idea that the brain is not fixed but can still grow and adapt, we just gotta keep those neural pathways nice and strong and how we do that? by working the ol' noodle upstairs, by learning new tasks and recalling information we are creating and re-enforcing neural pathways, (paths that connect the synapses in our brain). There are also a few activities we can do to support neuroplasticity and that is to do a bit of regular exercise and to also carry out healthy sleeping habits.

        But how can we get more powerful? Surely there is no stronger power than Neuroplasticity? What if we formed the ultimate team up known to man, it's even bigger than the Avengers, Spidermen, or even Whittakers choc and Hundreds & Thousands bickies,
        That's right we pair our friend Neuroplasticity with our good buddy the Growth Mindset. The growth mindset never sees a problem that it can't fix, as every problem is a source for growth, a challenge is just an opportunity for learning. Much like when he hit the gym to get swole, where anything worth doing requires a bit of effort, and if you find yourself struggling with something, you're on the right track to self improvement. Growth Mindset is King.

          With these powers combined... I think we can become developers!
